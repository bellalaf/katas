## Kata02: Karate Chop

<http://codekata.com/kata/kata02-karate-chop/>

Write a binary chop method that takes an integer search target and a sorted array of integers. It should return the integer index of the target in the array, or -1 if the target is not in the array. The signature will logically be:

`chop(int, array_of_int)  -> int`

This wants me to implement a binary search in five unique ways over the course of a week.
